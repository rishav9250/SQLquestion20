What are local and global variables and their differences?
Global Variable:
In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions. These variables have global scope, so they can be used by any function without passing them to the function as parameters.

Local Variable:
Local variables are variables that are defined within functions. They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them.
